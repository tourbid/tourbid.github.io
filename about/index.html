    		<p><b>tourbid.in</b> brings in a concept of bidding for your business & leisure travel requirements by 
    		      connecting travellers with tour operators, cabbies, hotels alike. 
    		      
    		      You just have to place your request for travel, say, 1 day trip from Bangalore to Mysore & back 
    		      for 6 people on 10th October 2015 and wait for responses. The backend system automatically notifies
    		      registered cab operators/owners who can revert back with their quotes. 
    		      
    		      Some key features include:
    		      - You will be be able to select your preferred cabbie based on the in-built recommendation system.
    		      - Post your trip, you are required to provide your feedback on the service which will aid future users. Similarly, operators too can leave a feedback on the user.
    		      - Reward system based on usage patterns as mutually agreed with users & providers.
